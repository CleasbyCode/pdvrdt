# pdvrdt
Use this command-line tool to embed or extract any file type via a **PNG** image.  
You can share your image on several *social media sites, which will retain the embedded data. 

**Image size limits vary across platforms:*

* *Flickr (200MB), ImgBB (32MB), PostImage (24MB), \*Reddit (20MB / -r option), Imgur (20MB / -i option)*
* *Mastodon (16MB / -m option), ImgPile (8MB), Imgur (5MB), \*Twitter (5MB / Dimension limits).*

Demo Videos: [**Twitter**](https://youtu.be/wSkP7LU7woQ) / [**Reddit**](https://youtu.be/7-ZbXv8NqA0) / [**Mastodon**](https://youtu.be/2giS6rP8dvI)

Your embedded data file is encrypted & compressed.

*To post/share file-embedded PNG images on **Reddit**, you need to use the **-r** option.*  
*To post/share file-embedded PNG images on **Mastodon**, you need to use the **-m** option.*  

As well as the 5MB image size limit, **Twitter** also has dimension size limits.  
*PNG-32/24 (Truecolor) 900x900 Max. 68x68 Min.*  
*PNG-8 (Indexed color) 4096x4096 Max. 68x68 Min.*  

*When posting file-embedded images on **Reddit**, always the select the "**Images & Video**" tab.*  
*When saving file-embedded images from **Reddit**, click the image in the post to expand it, then save it.
You should see the filename with a .png extension in the address bar of your browser.*  

*When saving file-embedded images from **Twitter**, always click the image first to fully expand it, before saving.*

*Using the **-i** option, increases the **Imgur** PNG default size limit from 5MB to 20MB.*

*Once the PNG image has been uploaded to your **Imgur** page, you can grab links of the image for sharing.*

*If the file-embedded image is over 5MB (when using the **-i** option), avoid posting the image to
the "*Imgur Community Page*", as the thumbnail preview fails and shows as a broken icon image.*

*(Clicking the "*broken*" preview image will still take you to the correctly displayed full image).*

Compile and run the program under Windows or **Linux**.
